# Tab Reaper: Keeper of Forgotten souls

    Welcome to **Tab Reaper**, the first snetinel of the machine universe [ihavenotnametheuniverseyet].
    This extension is not just a tool - it is a **judgement engine**, a scribe of memory, a harvester of the lost.

## The World of Tabs

    Long ago (long ago being when i got this new laptop in Oct '25), a chaotic force called the **Open Browser Window** ruled unopposed, leaving a trail of forgotten tabs across the land.

The **Tab Reaper** arose to bring order:

    - **Purgatory**: Tabs untouched for 5+ days are harvested here, awaiting judgement.
    - **Heaven**: Tabs that are valuable but not urgent ascend here, safe from closure.
    - **Hell**: Tabs deemed useless are erased from existence (yes i have a very bad habit of just not closing my tabs, no i will not just consciously let go of said habit)
    
    **Groups and pinned tabs** are sacred. 
        - **Groups**: Temples of structure in the sprawling chaos. used to serve my specific mental needs.
        -**Pinneds**: Immortal tabs that have been blessed by [usr] (i am [usr]) and therefore cannot be harvested. respect the pinneds.

## Features

    - Scan your browser for inactive tabs
    - Export lost tabs as **JSON tab souls**
    - Close the forgotten tabs to reclaim order
    - Preserve groups and pinned tabs
    - Automatic weekly reaping (coming soon)
    - Foundation for the Tab World UI where i shall play [usr]

## How to Install (dev mode for now i havent acc made the reaper public. might not even)

    1. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome or Chromium-based browsers.
    2. Enable **Developer Mode**
    3. Click **Load Unpacked** and select the `tab-reaper` folder.
    4. Open browser, click the Tab Reaper icon (i gotta make an icon acc), and harvest the lost tabs.

## Future Plans

    - Tab Purgatory interface with drag-and-drop heaven/hell
    - Merge JSONs into a master chronicle of all tab souls
    - Automatic weekly reaping
    - Integration of tab groups as “civilizations”
    - Expansion into a full **machine universe**, where each extension, terminal profile, and software piece becomes its own sentient entity (yes i am giving my machine lore.)

## notes

    The **Tav Reaper** is only the beginning.
    The machine is a universe, tabs are the first race of many, and [usr] is the deity who controls life, death, and legacy (through gamified tasks of course)

    The reaper is unhinged, efficient, and merciless (i know. it cleared half my tabs in one click).
